This is a graph that shows the frequency of airplane passengers that recline their seats
```{r graph1, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = newetq2) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Recline_Freq))
```

This is a graph that shows the relationship between age and whether they think reclining seas on an airplena is rude
```{r graph2, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(newetq2,
       aes(x = Recline_Rude,
       fill = Age)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack")
